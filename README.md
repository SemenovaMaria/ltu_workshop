# GitHub Workshop Guide: Basic Git Commands and Workflow

Welcome to the practical part of  workshop, where we'll dive into the Basic Git Commands and
Workflow. This guide is designed to be followed step-by-step as you learn the core operations of Git,
the widely used version control system. By the end of this session, you'll have hands-on experience
with creating a repository, making changes, and syncing those changes with a remote repository on
GitHub.

## Objective

You will learn how to:
- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Make changes, stage, and commit them.
- Push changes back to GitHub.

Before we begin, let's understand why we use Git. Git helps us track changes in our projects, allowing
multiple collaborators to work on the same project without overlapping each other's work. It's an
essential tool for version control and collaboration.
